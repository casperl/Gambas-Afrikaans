And do not forget that the Gambas IDE is written in Gambas! :-)

## How to add an application

[[ info
Feel free to add your applications, provided that it is more than ten lines of code, and that you respect the same page layout as other ones.
]]

Let\'s suppose that your application is named 'MyGreatSoftware'. We will put it under the '/app/mygreatsoftware' wiki path. The rule is putting all characters of the name in lower case, and using the minus character if needed.

So you have to enter the following URL into your browser:

    http://gambaswiki.org/wiki/app/mygreatsoftware

The wiki tells you that the page is not available. Then you click on the *Create* link.

To fill the page contents, just open an already existing  application page in editing mode, and use it as a template. Once done, just click on the *Save* button. That\'s all!
