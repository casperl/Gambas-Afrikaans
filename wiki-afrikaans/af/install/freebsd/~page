# FreeBSD

In order to compile Gambas on FreeBSD, you must install required development packages.

[[ info
For this How-to I\'m using pre-compiled packages, but you can use FreeBSD ports instead, of course. :-)
]]


Here is the packages list :

    # pkg_add -r autoconf268 automake111 libtool libffi bzip2 unixODBC mysql55-client postgresql91-client sqlite2 sqlite3 libXtst gtk20 librsvg2 cairo gdk-pixbuf imlib imlib2 curl pcre poppler qt4 qt4-moc sdl sdl_ttf sdl_mixer sdl_image libGL libGLU glew libv4l v4l_compat libxml2 libxslt

Once you\'ve installed these packages, you can create a repertory to get a copy of the branch development. For example in your **home/** :

    $ mkdir trunk
    $ svn checkout https://gambas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gambas/gambas/trunk/

Then, you can compile the Gambas source code:

    $ ./reconf-all
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Note you could obtain some problems at compile time because of some environment variables.\
Indeed, if you get an error about any linker options, don\'t forget to verify if you have well the *LD_LIBRARY_PATH* environment variable declared on your FreeBSD system.\
The value of this variable must contains : **/usr/local/lib**

Second thing, on \*BSD systems the OpenGL headers are located at **/usr/X11R6/include** .\
So once again, don\'t forget to add this path in the *CPATH* environment variable on your FreeBSD system. Otherwise you cannot compile the [../../comp/gb.qt4.opengl] component and all others related to this one.
