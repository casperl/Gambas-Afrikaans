## [Gambas 3]

### [Compilation from source]

#### [Getting the PKGBUILD script]
First of all you need a machine running traditional Arch Linux. Bring up a terminal and type:

    $ sudo pacman -S abs
    $ sudo abs community/gambas3

If everything went fine, you should now see something like:
    ==> Starting ABS sync...
    receiving file list ... done
    community/
    community/gambas3/
    community/gambas3/PKGBUILD
    community/gambas3/gambas3-runtime.install
    community/gambas3/gambas3-script.install

#### [Modifying the PKGBUILD script]

Now browse to ´/var/abs/community/gambas3´ and open the PKGBUILD file in a text editor of your choosing. Find the line that says:

    arch=('i686' 'x86_64')

and change it to say:

    arch=('armv6h')

#### [Running the PKGBUILD script]

Save the PKGBUILD file and copy the three files in the current folder over to a new folder in the home directory on your Raspbery Pi.
Install the dependencies listed on the [../archlinux] wiki site.
From a terminal, cd in to that new folder you just made and run ´$ makepkg´. This will download Gambas source files, compile them (can take the whole day) and create a bunch of Gambas 3 packages that you can now install on your Raspberry Pi with:

    $ sudo pacman -U *.xz

or just those you prefer with

    $ sudo pacman -U package_name_of_your_choosing.tar.xz
