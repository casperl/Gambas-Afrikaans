# Ubuntu (deprecated)

[[ info
The following instructions to install Gambas on Ubuntu is also applicable for Kubuntu and Xubuntu.
Gambas is installed with success from version 7.04.
]]

<!--{warning
Ubuntu 8.10 & 9.04 installs the new version of libtool by default, which does not work with Gambas. Please install and use the libtool 1.5 package instead if you want to compile Gambas.

To do that (on 64 bits x86 systems):
    $ sudo dpkg --force-downgrade -i libtool_1.5.26-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

I think you have to remove '_amd64' on 32 bits x86 systems.
}-->

Before going any further, consider using the .deb packages at:

[http://encryptec.net/software/gambas-packages] \(This site requires user name and password)\
[http://gambas.gnulinex.org/ubuntu] \(Completely free)

These instructions may well work with previous versions of Ubuntu, but I would strongly recommend upgrading to 7.04 before going any further. If you want to find the exact package versions supported on a given release of Ubuntu, it will take time. If you can upgrade first the procedure below should get you going \'first time\'.

* First you\'ll need to get the latest release of the source code.

* Next you need to make sure you have the right development packages installed. To do this, start a terminal session (Applications->Accessories->Terminal) and copy the contents of the box below into the terminal. The password it will prompt for will be YOUR password. (note that your userid will need super-user access to your system ..)

[[ info
For Gambas2, if you want pilot KDE application (example Kate) you must install:
kdebase-dev (kdelibs4-dev will be removed and replaced with kdelibs5-dev
and other package)
]]

* Unpack the source into '/usr/src'.
    $ cd /usr/src
    $ sudo tar xvfj /home/<your userid>/Desktop/gambas2-1.48.tar.bz2

* Or get a subversion snapshot as explained on the website.

* Move to the Gambas source folder and follow the build procedure. (check out the README file)
    $ cd /usr/src/gambas2-1.9.48
    $ sudo ./configure -C
    $ sudo make
    $ sudo make install

This should leave you with a working version of Gambas in '/usr/local/bin' .. so if you now type in "gambas2" from the terminal session, it should start your nice new IDE.

#### Note Kubuntu (wig)

Link on desktop or in menu: the executable is in
    /usr/local/bin/gambas2

You can replace the icon by
