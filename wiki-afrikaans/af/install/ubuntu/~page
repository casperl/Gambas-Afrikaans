### [<font color="green">Gambas 3 (version <= 3.4.2)</font>]

<i>Step 1.</i> Get the source code (either download and extract the package from main Gambas website or use svn checkout)

<i><b>Note:</b> For using svn checkout see [A note on installing from svn](#t9) and [Downloading Gambas from Subversion repository](#t10)</i>

<i>Step 2.</i> When installing first update the sources:

    $ sudo apt-get update

<i>Step 3.</i> Install these packages :

Open a terminal and do:

[[ warning
**Note:** For trunk version you might need to install more dependencies as new components get developed.
For more recent versions of Ubuntu you might need higher versions of dependencies than mentioned above.

For older versions of Ubuntu dependencies might have a to low version resulting in some components not being compiled.
E.g Version on `/trunk` and 3.8 or higher needs qt5 packages for version 5.3 or higher, Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 have qt5 packages for version 5.2.

## [<font color="darkblue">Important notes</font>]

### [<font color="blue">A note on installing from svn</font>]

If you want to compile the latest '/trunk' development version or a stable version from svn, you need to install subversion first.

To do this open a terminal and do:

    $ sudo apt-get install subversion

You will now be able to do a svn checkout.

### [<font color="blue">Downloading Gambas from Subversion repository</font>]

Everybody can make a copy of the repository on his hard disk by using the following command:

<b>For trunk version</b>

    $ svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/gambas/code/gambas/trunk

<b>For current stable version (3.8)</b>

    $ svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/gambas/code/gambas/branches/3.8

<b>For an old stable version (e.g. 3.6)</b>

    $ svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/gambas/code/gambas/branches/3.6

### [<font color="blue">A note on package dependencies</font>]

As dependencies may change over time it is always a good thing to know what is available on Ubuntu and in what repository.

Check <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/"target="_blank">Ubuntu Package Search</a> for the availability of needed dependency packages on Ubuntu.

If you scroll down on the page you can search for a package and find out what repositories hold them.

<img src="http://develop.earthshipeurope.org/Gambas3/AppImage/UbuntuPack.png"><br/>
<i>Search for package llvm-3.3-dev shows us it is available in precise-updates, saucy and trusty.</i>

## [<font color="darkblue">Gambas 2</font>]
