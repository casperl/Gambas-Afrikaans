# The Program has stopped unexpectedly!

This message is displayed by the Development Environment when the running project crashes.

This is not a bug in your project, but a bug in the interpreter. This message should never occur, but nothing is perfect is this world!

What you can try before reporting the bug:

* Check your Gambas version, and try to install the latest one provided by your distribution.

* If you have already the latest version provided by your distribution, try to compile the version located in the subversion repository.

## Automatic report by mail

Since Gambas 3.5, the IDE now displays a dialog when a crash occurs that allows you to send a bug report by mail.

The bug report will include:

* An archive of the project sources.
* The contents of the IDE system information dialog.
* Your project configuration file.

Moreover, if core dumps have been enabled before the crash, and if 'gdb' is installed on your system, a stack backtrace will be added.
This is almost mandatory for debugging, so do not hesitate to install gdb and to enable core dumps!
