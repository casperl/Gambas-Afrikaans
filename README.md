# Gambas-Afrikaans

A repository for the current state of the Afrikaans translation of Gambas that I am doing.

There is also a small introductory website for this translation project at https://sites.google.com/site/gambasafrikaans/

At present it is my intention to translate the following:

* The Gambas IDE and environment.
* The Gambas Wiki component.
* The project descriptions in the Gambas Server Farm. 
* Any associated Gambas components that contain translatable files.
* The Gambas Reference wiki on the Gambas language
* Possible some tutorials and walk-throughs written in Afrikaans and posted here.
* If possible I will include a dump of the above Google Sites website in this repository.

Any other contributors to an Afrikaans translation project is of course welcome to clone this Git repository and start translating.  But mainly, this repository is to keep me motivated in completing the translation project and to illustrate the current progress thereof.
